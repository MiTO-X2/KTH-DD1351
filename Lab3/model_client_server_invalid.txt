af(ok).

% On all paths starting from the initial state, eventually ok will hold 
% i.e., the system guarantees success regardless of nondeterministic choices.

% There exists a path that avoids success and instead leads to permanent failure: 
% s0 -> s1 -> s3 -> s5 -> s4 and s4 loops on itself (fail state). 
% From s4 there is no path to ok. Because there is at least one path where ok never occurs, 
% AF ok fails in the initial state.

% M, s0 |= AF ok should fail.
