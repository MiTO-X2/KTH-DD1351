s0.

ef(ok).

% There exists a path from the initial state such that at some future point ok holds 
% (i.e., a successful response occurs along some possible execution).

% From s0 we can go to s1 (sent) and then to s2 (ok). 
% Thus there is a path s0 -> s1 -> s2 where ok is reached. 
% So EF ok is true in the initial state s0.

% M, s0 |= EF ok should succeed.
